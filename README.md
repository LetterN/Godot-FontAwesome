# FontAwesome plugin for Godot (SVG)

Use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) 6.0 on Godot 4.0! This branch uses SVG instead of icons. You cannot change the color unfortunatnly.

Please note that the plugin version is equal to the fontawesome version it is using.

## Usage

Create a new "FontAwesome" Node and configure it's values. To change color, simply go to theme overrides and change the font color.

## Updating

Simply copy new [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) `.woff2` fonts in `addons/fontawesome/fonts` and copy `all.min.js` in utils, then open `dump_eet.html`. Copy the output and paste on `All.gd`
